This is a dynamic Python program that performs Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption based on user input. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 4:

A → E B → F C → G and so on...
